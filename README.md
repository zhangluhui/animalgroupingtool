<h1><b>Animal Grouping Tool</b></h1>
The <a href="http://zhangluhui.shinyapps.io/mousegroupingtool">animal grouping tool</a> is designed to efficiently organize mice (or other species if possible, such as rat and rabbit) into multiple groups while ensuring that each group exhibits consistent means and variances in body weight. Additionally, it aims to minimize the need for intermixing mice from different housing cages (minimizing mouse order changes as shown in the results given by the app), thereby optimizing the handling and care of the mice.
